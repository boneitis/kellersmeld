_From that moment, I understood the direct pathway [..] to freedom._

### An Open Proposal to Whom It May Concern
An experimental survey of, through **sensory touch**, the viability of relegating content consumption to passive, and often non-primary, focus as emergent tasks tap into and out of sensory bandwidth (i.e., sight, hearing, and active touch).

This is envisioned to be accomplished with a small, vibrating motor disc affixed inconspicuously to the user's skin (hand, waistline, or where choose you) **transmitting textual data by rhythmic, Morse code-keyed pulsations**.

Prototyping efforts and proofs of concept may aim to implement support for:
* unencumbered eBook formats _(for discreet Dark Arts attainment, a la Frederick Douglass)_
* submission-discussion forums _(for always-on always-connectedness, a la ~~your tween-aged loved ones~~, I mean ~~the Borg Collective~~ ..nevermind.)_

Milestones beyond proof-of-concept
* transcribed material _(i.e., documentaries and podcasts)_
* encumbered standards _(eBooks and such)_, via commercial pursuits and licensing arrangements
* pulling live updates from monitored channels (RSS, alerting policies)
* your favorite blog, newsletter, or other publishing platform
* doomscrolling (doomtouching?)

### Hardware Brainstorm

#### Development Variant
* STM
* DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller
* Vibrating motor disc
* Bluetooth LE module, if not built in

#### Other Candidate Hardware
* Some single-board computer of sorts
* Adafruit
* STM
* Pi Zero
* hackable or reverse-engineered adult toy

#### Stretch Goals
* general-purpose IO for mobile devices _(texting, $#!+posting)_
* further IO augmentation with effects and intensity _(menu/state navigation)_
* passive consumption of advertisments _(eek!)_
