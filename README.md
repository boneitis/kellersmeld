_From that moment, I understood the direct pathway [...] to freedom._

### Personal Research into Passive Content Consumption via Tactile Media
An experimental survey of content consumption by tactile means, enabling seamless, bidirectional relegation-and-promotion between primary and passive attentions of sensory channels _(i.e., **touch in addition** to sight and sound)_.

Prototyping efforts aim to implement discrete modules supporting:
* unencumbered eBook formats _(for discreet Dark Arts attainment, a la Frederick Douglass)_
* submission-discussion websites _(for always-on Social Media always-connectedness, a la ~~your addicted tween- and teen-aged loved ones~~the Borg Collective)_

With warmth, please consider always the value of unplugging.

Proposed longterm milestones _(most-probably out of scope)_ envision to implement additional modules that cover primarily-text-based web content, such as:
* transcribed content, namely, documentaries and podcasts
* encumbered standards _(commercial eBooks and the like)_, via licensing arrangements
* pulling live updates from monitored channels
* half-facetiously, your favorite massively online publishing platforms
* the other half toward feeding your immediate-finging and tome-chirping addictions

### Hardware Brainstorm

#### Development Variant
* Adafruit FLORA
* DRV2605L Haptic Motor Controller
* Vibrating motor disc
* Bluefruit LE

#### Other Proposed Variants
* Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express, ..., etc.
* Adafruit Circuit Playground, Bluefruit ed., ..., etc.
* hackable or reverse-engineered adult toy

#### Stretch Features, Out of Prototyping Scope
* general-purpose IO for mobile devices _(texting, flowerposting)_
* advertising via the tactile medium _(eek!)_
